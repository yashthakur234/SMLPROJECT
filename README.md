## Abstract

Handwritten digit classification is a key application in machine learning, aimed at recognizing and categorizing handwritten digits (0–9). This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve digit recognition using the MNIST dataset, a benchmark collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is preprocessed through normalization, reshaping, and one-hot encoding to ensure compatibility with the CNN architecture.

The proposed CNN comprises convolutional layers for feature extraction, max-pooling for dimensionality reduction, dropout layers for overfitting prevention, and dense layers for classification. Performance evaluation demonstrates excellent results, achieving 99.2% accuracy on both validation and test datasets. The system shows strong generalization, as evidenced by accurate predictions on unseen data.

Future directions include exploring advanced architectures like ResNet, expanding datasets for greater robustness, and deploying the model in real-world applications, including web and mobile platforms. This project highlights the effectiveness of CNNs for handwritten digit recognition and sets the stage for further enhancements and practical implementation.
